			<p>A Philippines lawmaker is set to spend a second night holed up in the Senate Wednesday after the country's president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced he was seeking his arrest over coup attempts that happened over a decade ago.</p>
			<p>Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a long standing and vocal critic of Duterte, told CNN he would remain in the Senate where he remains under the protection of Senate leaders while his lawyers examined his options.</p>
			<p>As night fell, armed police officers stood guard outside the building awaiting for Trillanes to leave, according to CNN Philippines.</p>
			<p>The senator received amnesty in 2011 under President Benigno Aquino for his involvement in three coups attempts in 2003, 2006 and 2007 during Gloria Arroyo's presidency. In an advertisement in national newspaper Manila Times, Duterte said clemency for the senator had been voided due to his "failure to apply for amnesty and refusal to admit his guilt."</p>
			<p>Trillanes told CNN that he considered the proclamation to be based on "questionable and outright baseless lies," and said he and his legal team would "question the validity and legality of this presidential declaration through the Supreme Court." He added that, along with video evidence of his filing his request for amnesty, he was in possession of a certificate of amnesty given to him by the Aquino administration.</p>

			<blockquote style="font-size:2em; padding: 20px 80px 20px 80px" cite="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/05/asia/philippines-duterte-antonio-trillanes-amnesty-intl/index.html">
					"The application was processed having satisfied all the requirements, a certificate of the amnesty was given to me, that is the proof of its validity."
				</blockquote>

			<p>Regardless, he said he would comply with the Justice Department should he be arrested. "I will not resist arrest. I will not escape," he said.
			He is not the first opponent of the president to be threatened with arrest -- in 2017 staunch Duterte opponent Leila De Lima was arrested after having been accused of abetting the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was justice secretary from 2010 to 2015. She has consistently insisted she has no involvement in the illegal drug trade.</p>
